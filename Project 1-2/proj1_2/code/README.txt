Notes: For implementing the graph_search.py part, I received assist from 
Bozhou Zha. He helped me sorted out the algorithm and gave me some tips
on modifying superfluous statements. And I cannot pass the Up case entirely, 
he found my mistake was wrongly computed the cost function. After fixing this 
intuitive error I passed all the cases.
And I also talked with Yongxin Guo about how to implementing the algorithm.
