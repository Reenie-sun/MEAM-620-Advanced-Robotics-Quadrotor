This README file is for MEAM 620 proj 1_3. 
Collaborators: Yongxin Guo, Yihang Xu
I get a little inspirations on getting sparse points from Yongxin Guo. Yihang Xu is one of my teammates so I discussed with him as well. 
The submitted version is not a final version of the program. I made some further modifications to get a more simple sparse points path which results
in  better performance. 

Note£ºI forget to upload my README file at the first time. So I submit it along with mymap.json
